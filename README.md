## Lectures
### Lecture 1: Household surveys
In this lecture we will study the importance of the household surveys as inputs for poverty and distributional analysis. We will recognize the importance of household surveys for social research and the generation of welfare indicators. Moreover we will use the [*Encuesta Nacional de Hogares*](http://iinei.inei.gob.pe/microdatos/) from Peru to make a exploratory analysis of personal income distribution.
